**Note on Pop-up Functionality:**
A GitHub `README.md` file is a static markdown document. It does not support interactive features like pop-up windows or buttons that execute JavaScript. If you want a contact form that pops up, you would typically implement that on a personal website, and then link to that website from your GitHub README.
